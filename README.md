Welcome to my threat hunt creation repository. Here I document threat hunt scenarios and their walkthroughs. Thank you for visiting!

Any similarities to real individuals, organizations, or events are purely coincidental. The investigation techniques, queries, and methodologies demonstrated are based on real-world cybersecurity practices but are applied in a simulated environment. This content is intended to showcase threat hunting skills, analytical thinking, and investigative processes for professional development. It does not reflect or promote any actual security incidents or breaches.)
