# Steven's Threat Hunt Repository
Welcome to my threat hunt creation repository. Here I document the creation of threat hunt scenarios and associated threat hunt reports. I'll also have a section for other threat hunting projects or CTFs I complete. Click the links below to enjoy. Thank you for visiting!

⚠️ Disclaimer: This repository and github site presents fictional threat hunting scenarios created for educational and portfolio purposes. Any similarities to real individuals, organizations, or events are purely coincidental. The investigation techniques, queries, and methodologies demonstrated are based on real-world cybersecurity practices but are applied in a simulated environment. This content is intended to showcase threat hunting skills, analytical thinking, and investigative processes for professional development. It does not reflect or promote any actual security incidents or breaches.
