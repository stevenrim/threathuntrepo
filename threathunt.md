# Threat Hunt Report: Unauthorized Download, Installation, and Use of TOR
## Platforms Used
- EDR: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Query Language: KQL (Kusto Query Language)
- Windows VM on Azure
## Scenario
An alert was triggered in the security monitoring system regarding unusual network activity originating from an internal workstation in the finance department. The workstation, assigned to Sam, a mid-level employee, exhibited encrypted traffic patterns that indicated connections to known TOR exit nodes. This behavior raised red flags, as the use of TOR and similar privacy tools were strictly prohibited within the organization.
To address these concerns, I was tasked to investigate Sam's workstation for any signs of unusual activity.
