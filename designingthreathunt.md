# Designing the Threat Hunt Scenario (Unauthorized TOR Usage)
**Unauthorized TOR Browser Installation and Use**

Sam, a mid-level employee in the finance department, was growing increasingly frustrated with the company's strict internet usage policies. He felt that his personal browsing and online interests were being overly restricted and after some research, he came across TOR, a privacy tool that promised to mask his internet traffic and give him the anonymity he desired. Also, the IT team didn't deprovision his workstation from the previous employee/user (stevenmde). Did they not even care or were they being incompetent? Regardless, Sam felt that his actions would go undetected and decided to install the TOR browser during a quiet evening shift.

## Steps to take as a "bad actor" to create logs and IoCs:
1. Download the TOR browser installer: https://www.torproject.org/download/
2. Install it silently: ```.\tor-browser-windows-x86_64-portable-14.0.6.exe /S```
3. Open the TOR browser from the folder on the desktop
4. Connect to TOR and browse a few sites: Google.com, Yahoo.com, and Reddit.com
6. Create a file on the desktop called ```tor-shopping-list.txt``` and make a shopping list for the darkweb. 
7. Delete the file.
